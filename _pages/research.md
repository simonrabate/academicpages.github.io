- *The Effects of Increasing the Normal Retirement Age: Evidence From the Netherlands*,  
with Tilbe Atav and Egbert Jongen

    - **Abstract**  
    We evaluate the effect of reforms in the social retirement age in the Netherlands (AOW age) on the labour supply and enrollment in social insurance of older workers. The AOW increased stepwise from 65 in 2013 to 65 and 9 months in 2017 (end of the data period). As a result, individuals are subjected to different retirement ages depending on their month of birth. We exploit this variation between birth cohorts using a differences-in-differences approach. Using administrative data from 1999 to 2017 we find that for the affected cohorts the employment rate increases by 16 percentage points during the additional working age months. Furthermore, we find that individuals on unemployment and disability insurance remain in their state longer, but there is hardly any direct substitution towards UI and DI from employment.

- *Incentives and Labor Force Participation of Older Workers: Evidence from France*,  
with Antoine Bozio, Maxime Tô and Julie Tréguier  

    - **Abstract**  
    This paper estimates the impact of financial incentives on retirement decision in France 
    for cohorts of men retiring between 1994 to 2012. During these two decades, a number of reforms 
    of the pension system took place, all aiming to achieve financial balance in a context of 
    increasing life expectancy. These reforms strengthened incentives to retire later, either 
    by offering more actuarially fair increase in pension for later retirement or by increasing 
    early and normal retirement ages. This paper aims to assess how much these financial incentives 
    and age references did contribute to the recent increase in employment rates of older workers.
